# A Smart and Simplified Grading System

## Description
This repository represents a remote collaboration for SmartGrade offered by the University of Pretoria. SmartGrade is a web application that will simplify the grading process for lecturers and teachers. This system automates the mark allocation process and by having such a system in place, it can also identify students that are struggling and provide predictive analysis to see what forms of assessment students are doing better in. This helps in adjusting learning outcomes to target areas where students struggle.

    <br>
    Young, passion driven BSc Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria. I believe diligence is key in being able to achieve any task in life and with that comes the need for discipline through hard work, however, with applying smart work ethic. My years in university have enabled me to develop good organizational skills, an analytical/logical approach to tasks and the ability to work under pressure. I can work well both on my own initiative and as part of a team.
